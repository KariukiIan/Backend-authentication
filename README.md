This is a back-end project. I used the following to build the server, protect it's routes, and finally authenticate and authorize its users:

Node.js - back-end runtime for Javascript.
NPM - install dependencies.
Express Framework - used this framework to create REST APIs.
MongoDB & Mongoose - My database.
JWT - create user tokens
Bcrypt - ecrypt user passwords.
Cloudinary - save images to the cloud.
Multer - Node.js middleware for uploading files.
Postman - for testing my APIs.
